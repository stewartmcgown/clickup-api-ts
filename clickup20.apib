## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate with ClickUp API 2.0, with a personal token or creating an application and authenticating with an OAuth2 flow. Once you receive one of those two tokens, use that in the `Authorization` header of your API requests.

**IMPORTANT** - _If you are creating an application for others to use, it is highly recommended that you use the OAuth2 flow._

### Personal Token
If you are using the API for personal use, it is safe to use the personal API token. You can find this token in your user settings, under the `Apps` section. At the top of the page you have the option to generate a personal token. These tokens will always begin with `pk_`.

![personal_token](https://attachments3.clickup.com/343f245e-7d27-411d-96d0-9ad3a6f2f8a7/personal_token.png)

If your token becomes compromised, you can regenerate it. However, be aware that any applications that were using the old token will lose access once it has been regenerated.

### OAuth2 Flow
When you want to develop an application that others can use, you must go through the OAuth2 flow so that every user that uses your application gets assigned an individualized token. This way each user of your application is able to access their own ClickUp resources. If you are unfamiliar with OAuth2, Digital Ocean has put together a great [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2) that should get you started.

***Note:** ClickUp uses the authorization code grant type.*

#### How To Use the ClickUp OAuth2 Flow

1. **Create An OAuth App** - As an admin, navigate to your team settings and click on the `Integrations` section. Once there, click on the icon that is labeled "ClickUp API" and create a new app. When you create an app, you will be prompted to enter a name, and at least one redirect url. When your app is created, you will be provided with a `client_id` and a `secret`.
2. **Authorization Code** - You must first retrieve an authorization code from your user before you can get an access token for their account.
   - To start this process, redirect the user to `https://app.clickup.com/api?client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}` with the redirect query parameter set to a redirect uri that you specified when creating the oauth app. The host of the redirect uri must match one of those redirect uris or the request will fail. The protocol will default to https if not provided, and non-ssl redirect uris may not be supported in the future.
   - Once the user has accepted or rejected the authorization request, they will be redirected back to the `redirect_uri` with the necessary query parameters for getting an access token.
3. **Access Token** - Once you have retrieved the authorization code in the previous step, you can then use the route `POST /api/v2/oauth/token` with the parameters `client_id`, `client_secret` , and `code` to get the user access token. This is the token that is used in the `Authorization` header for all requests in the ClickUp API. Skip to the authorization section below for more information on this route.
4. **Token Teams** - When you redirect your user in step 2 of this flow, they will be prompted which teams (Workspaces) they want to grant you access to. Therefore in order to access a specific Workspace for the user, you need to ensure that they have given you access. You can use the route `GET /api/v2/team` to see which Workspaces they have authorized you to access. If they have not given you access to the appropriate Workspaces, you can redirect them to the authorization code URL from step 2 at any time to reauthorize your app. Below is a screenshot of what the user sees when they visit this URL.

## Rate Limiting
The API is rate limited per OAuth and personal token. You will receive a 429 HTTP status code if you exceed the rate limit. The rate limit varies based on [plan](https://clickup.com/expandplans):
- **Free Forever**, **Unlimited**, and **Business Plan**: 100 requests per minute per token
- **Business Plus Plan**: 1,000 requests per minute per token
- **Enterprise Plan**: 10,000 requests per minute per token

Learn more about our [ClickUp Plans](https://clickup.com/pricing).

## Error Handling
Errors responses will return a non-200 status code and a json err message and error code.

Common errors include:

**`Team not authorized`**: This error is thrown when a team was not authorized by the user for a particular access token. Refer to the `Token Teams` section of the OAuth instructions for more information on how to fix this error. Error codes that are associated with this message include `OAUTH_023`, `OAUTH_026`, `OAUTH_027`, and `OAUTH_029` to `OAUTH_045`

**`Token not found`**: This error is thrown if authorization is revoked by the user, as described in the "Personal Token" section. Error codes that are associated with this message include `OAUTH_019`, `OAUTH_021`, `OAUTH_025`, and `OAUTH_077`

**`Authorization Header Required`**: The authorization token was missing in the `Authorization` http header. `OAUTH_017`

**`Client Not Found`**: The client application was not created correctly. `OAUTH_010`

**`Redirect URI not passed`**: The redirect URI was not present during the OAuth authentication flow. Refer to the section "Create An OAuth App" to resolve this error. `OAUTH_017`

**`Redirect URI does not match the redirect uris of this application`**: The redirect URI must be registered with your client application. Refer to the section "Create An OAuth App" to resolve this error. `OAUTH_007`

## FAQ

> What is `team` in reference to?

Teams is the legacy term for what are now called Workspaces in ClickUp. For compatibility, the term `team` is still used in this API to refer to Workspaces. In our API documentation, `team_id` refers to the id of a Workspace, and `group_id` refers to the id of a user group.

> What `Content-Type` should I use?

When formatting your requests to ClickUp, please always use the content type `application/json`. Using form encoded data is not fully supported and can result in unexpected consequences.

> How are projects and Folders related?

Projects are what we used to call Folders in ClickUp V1. If you use the first version of the API, the items that are returned to you as projects are the same as Folders in the second version of the API. You must use the correct nomenclature depending on the version of the API you are using (`project` for V1 and `folder` for V2) and cannot interchange them.

> Does the access token returned from `POST /api/v2/oauth/token` expire?

The access token does not expire at this time.

> Is it possible to move a task between lists using the API?

It is not possible to move a task between lists at this time. This is a complicated process, however we hope to implement this on the public API in the near future.

> Will tasks created via API generate notifications?

Yes, all actions you take with the public api will trigger all of the same process that would occur through the UI. This includes notifications, websocket messages, webhooks, etc.

> How do I tell who has access to a particular task?

To get a list of team members that have access to a particular task or list, use the routes `GET /api/v2/task/{{task_id}}/member` and `GET /api/v2/list/{{list_id}}/member` under the "Members" section of this documentation.

> How are dates formatted in ClickUp?

ClickUp will always display dates in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in milliseconds. You can use a website like [Epoch Converter](https://epochconverter.com) to convert dates between Unix and human readable date formats.

> What timezone does your API use for timestamps?

Our API always returns timestamps in [UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).

> How are subtasks represented in the API?

Subtasks are identical to tasks in every way. Therefore, you can manipulate subtasks the same way you would update any task with the API. To check if a task object is a subtask or not, locate the `parent` property. If this value is `null` then it is not a subtask, otherwise it will contain the task ID of the subtask's parent.

To create a subtask, use `POST /api/v2/list/:list_id/task` and make sure to set the `parent` property in the body of the request. Similarly, to update or delete existing subtasks, use the routes `PUT /api/v2/task/:task_id` and `DELETE /api/v2/task/:task_id` respectively. To fetch subtasks, get the parent task and add the subtask query param (`GET /api/v2/task/:parent_id?include_subtasks=true`) or use the search team route with that same query param (`GET /api/v2/team/:team_id/task?subtasks=true`).

## Attachments [/attachment]

To post an attachment to ClickUp, you must send the desired file in a `POST` request to the following route. Uploading attachments to ClickUp is one of the only times that you will not use `Content-Type: application/json`, instead you must send the file in the `multipart/form-data` format. Depending on what language you are building your application in, the method of formatting each request is going to look quite different.

If you are unfamiliar with this request body format, check out this article ([Understanding HTML Form Encoding: URL Encoded and Multipart Forms](https://dev.to/sidthesloth92/understanding-html-form-encoding-url-encoded-and-multipart-forms-3lpa)) which does a great job describing how you would POST an attachment from the browser. It also explains what the raw HTTP request looks like, which is helpful if you are making the request server side.

You will not be able to add attachments using the Console feature on this website. You can experiment with this endpoint using an app like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). You can easily upload an attachment via `multipart/form-data` with Postman by following these [instructions](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/requests/#form-data).

Finally, we have provided an example of how you would post an attachment with `Node.js`:

```
const FormData = require('form-data');
const axios = require('axios');
const fs = require('fs');

const form = new FormData();

form.append('filename', '')
form.append('attachment', fs.createReadStream('./img.png'));

const headers = form.getHeaders();

headers.authorization = `Bearer ${your_api_token}`;

axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: 'https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/task/123/attachment',
  data: form,
  headers,
})
  .then(() => console.log('success'))
  .catch(() => console.log('fail'));
```

***Note:** Make sure that your file is named `attachment` otherwise the API will not recognize the file.*

## Comments [/comment]
#####Viewing Comments
By default, if you do not include the start and start_id parameters, the GET calls will return the most recent 25 comments on the specified task, Chat view, or List.

To retrieve older comments:

Locate the last (oldest) comment in the response body and add the following values to the parameters of your next call:
- Add the date value to the start parameter
- Add the comment id value to the start_id parameter

Both parameters are required to retrieve the next 25 comments. Repeat as needed to page through all task comments.

When you've reached the final page of comments, you'll either have less than 25 comments in the response, or when you send the next call with the start and start_id parameters, you'll receieve the following response:
```json
{
"comments": []
}
```

***Note:** In the ClickUp UI, the `text` is displayed as "Long Text" and `short_text` is displayed as "Text".*

#### The Field Object

```json
{
    "id": "5dc86497-098d-4bb0-87d6-cf28e43812e7",
    "name": "Text Field",
    "type": "text",
    "type_config": {},
    "date_created": "1577378759142",
    "hide_from_guests": false
}
```

#### Type Config

The `type_config` property is used to set configurations that are specific to a certain field type.

##### Drop Down

The drop down options exist in the `options` array, their order is determined by their array index. A `placeholder` value (string) and `default` option are available, but are not currently in use on the front end.

```json
{
    "name": "My Drop Down Field",
    "type": "drop_down",
    "type_config": {
        "default": 0,
        "placeholder": "Select a value",
        "options": [
            {
                "id": "UUID",
                "name": "Option 1",
                "color": "#FFFFF"
            },
            {
                "id": "UUID",
                "name": "Option 2",
                "color": "#000000"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

##### Currency

The `default` option is available, but not currently in use by the FE.

```json
{
    "name": "My Currency Field",
    "type": "currency",
    "type_config": {
        "precision": 2,
        "currency_type": "USD",
        "default": 10
    }
}
```

##### Emoji

The `code_point` property must be a valid Unicode **emoji** code point value, many times written like `U+1f613`. Please omit the `U+` and only pass the hex value of the code point as a string. The `count` property denotes how many emoji values the rating can hold (min 1, max 5).

```json
{
    "name": "My Emoji Rating Field",
    "type": "emoji",
    "type_config": {
        "code_point": "1f613",
        "count": 5
    }
}
```

##### Labels

Labels is very similar to drop down, except you can set multiple option values.

```json
{
    "name": "My Label Field",
    "type": "labels",
    "type_config": {
        "options": [
            {
                "id": "UUID",
                "label": "Label 1",
                "color": "#123456"
            },
            {
                "id": "UUID",
                "label": "Label 2",
                "color": "#FFFFFF"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

##### Automatic Progress

```json
{
    "name": "Automatic Progress Bar",
    "type": "progress",
    "type_config": {
        "method": "automatic",
        "tracking": {
            "subtasks": true,
            "assigned_comments": true,
            "checklists": true
        }
    }
}
```

##### Manual Progress

```json
{
    "name": "Manual Progress Bar",
    "type": "progress",
    "type_config": {
        "method": "manual",
        "start": 0,
        "end": 100
    }
}
```

#### Field Values

To set a field value on a task use the route `POST /api/v2/task/{{task_id}}/field/{{field_id}}`. The request will always require the body `{ value: ... }` with the type of value being dependent on what type of field it is.

##### Url

The value must be a string and a valid url

```json
{ "value": "https://clickup.com" }
```

##### Drop Down

The value must be a UUID that matches the drop down option that you retrieve from `type_config`

```json
{ "value": "UUID" }
```

##### Email

The value must be a string and a valid email.

```json
{ "value": "lana@clickup.com" }
```

##### Phone

The value must be a string and a valid phone number with country code.

```json
{ "value": "+1 123 456 7890" }
```

##### Date

The `"value"` must be Unix time in milliseconds. By default, or if you include `"time": false` only the date is displayed in the ClickUp UI. To display the time in the ClickUp UI, include `"time": true` as shown in the example below. 

***Note:** When requesting tasks that include a Date Custom Field (such as when using `GET task` or other calls) but that do not include or display a time in the ClickUp UI, the API will return a value in Unix time in milliseconds of 4:00 am in the authorized user's timezone.*

```json
{ 
    "value": 1565993299379 
    "value_options": {
        "time": true
    }
}
```

##### Text

The value must be a string

```json
{ "value": "Some text" }
```

##### Checkbox

The value must be a boolean

```json
{ "value": true }
```

##### Number

The value must be a number

```json
{ "value": -28 }
```

##### Currency

The value must be a number.

```json
{ "value": 80000 }
```

##### Tasks

The value must be an object with the following format. The task_ids in `add` will get added to the field, and the task_ids in `rem` will be removed. The user must have access to all of the tasks in the request.

```json
{
    "value": {
        "add": ["wmq3", "qt15"],
        "rem": ["wxm7"]
    }
}
```

##### Users

The value must be an object with the following format. The users in `add` will get added to the field, and the users in `rem` will be removed.

```json
{
    "value": {
        "add": [184, 193],
        "rem": [183]
    }
}
```

##### Filter by Users

To filter by users with the GET Filtered Team Tasks endpoint, input each `user_id` as an array into the `value` parameter.

```json
{
   "field_id":"bd12538-4cf0-51f3-13h1-a1c0bedae3f7",
   "operator":"ANY",
   "value":[123456,765432]
}
```

##### Emoji

The value must be an integer that meets the following condition: `0 <= value >= field.type_config.count`.

```json
{
    "value": 4
}
```

##### Automatic Progress

Task value is automatically calculated for each task, trying to set a value will error.

##### Manual Progress

If the field is manual progress, the value must be and object with the **current** value of the progress. For example, if your start and end is `10` and `30` respectively, you would need to pass `20` to make the progress bar at `50%`.

```json
{
    "value": {
        "current": 20
    }
}
```

##### Labels

The value must be an object with the following format. The UUID's for each label must come from the field's type_config. Any labels that currently exist will be overridden.

```json
{
    "value": ["UUID_1", "UUID_2"]
}
```

## Tasks [/tasks]
####Setting Assignees
`assignees` is an array of the assignees' user ids to be added to this task. You can view the available user ids using the `Get Teams` (Workspaces) call.

####Setting Priority
`priority` is a number that corresponds to the Priorities available in the ClickUp UI. As in the ClickUp UI, priorities cannot be customized.

`1` is Urgent

`2` is High

`3` is Normal

`4` is Low

####Setting Time estimates
`time_estimate` values use milliseconds.

####Formatting in a Task Description
To use double quotation marks in the `text_content`, `description`, and `markdown_description` fields you must escape the `"` character with `\`. 

For example, including this:
`"description": "Here is some text. \"This is speech.\" Additional text."` 

Will look like this in the ClickUp UI: 
`Here is some text. "This is speech." Additional text.`

####Using Markdown in the Task Description
Instead of `description` you can pass `markdown_description` with valid markdown syntax to add formatting to the task description. 

Markdown features that are supported include headers, emphasis, unordered lists, ordered lists, images, links, blockquotes, and inline code.

For more information on markdown syntax, follow github's guide [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Create Task [POST /list/{list_id}/task{?custom_task_ids,team_id}]

+ Parameters
    + list_id: 123 (number)

+ Request
`check_required_custom_fields` is an option to indicate whether or not your new task will include data for required Custom Fields (`true`) or not (`false`). The default is `false`. If you set this option to `true`, and do not include information for required Custom Fields, then you will receive an error that "One or more required fields is missing".
The `links_to` accepts a task ID to create a linked dependency on the new task.
If `notify_all` is true, creation notifications will be sent to everyone including the creator of the task.
Passing an existing task ID in the `parent` property will make the new task a subtask of that parent. The `parent` you pass must not be a subtask itself, and must be part of the list that you pass in the URL params.

## Teams: Workspaces [/teams]
Teams is the legacy term for what are now called Workspaces in ClickUp. For compatibility, the term `team` is still used in this API to refer to Workspaces. In our API documentation, `team_id` refers to the id of a Workspace, and `group_id` refers to the id of a user group.

## Teams: User Groups [/group]
These endpoints are used to manage [Teams: user groups](https://docs.clickup.com/en/articles/4010016-teams-how-to-create-user-groups) which are groups of users you can assign items to in your Workspace. In our API documentation, `team_id` refers to the id of a Workspace, and `group_id` refers to the id of a user group.

***Note:** Adding a guest with view only permissions to a Team automatically converts them to a paid guest. If you don't have any paid guest seats available, a new member seat is automatically added to increase the number of paid guest seats available which incurs a prorated charge based on your billing cycle.*

## Views [/view]

While you can use the ClickUp API to manage the views that you have access to through the UI, they are great for filtering and sorting tasks. Below is an example view object and an explanation of each part.


#### The View Object
```
{
    "name": "View Name,
    "type": "list",

    "parent": {
        "id": 333,
        "type": 7
    },

    "grouping": {
        "field": "status",
        "dir": 1
    },

    "filters": {
        "op": "AND",
        "fields": [
            {
                "field": "assignee",
                "op": "EQ",
                "values": []
            }
        ],
        "search": "",
        "show_closed": false
    },

    "sorting": {
        "fields": [
            {
                "field": "dateCreated",
                "dir": -1
            }
        ]
    },

    "columns": {
        "fields": [
            {
                "field": "dateCreated"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```


##### View Types
The view `type` describes what kind of view the object is. This value can be either `list`, `board`, `calendar`, or `gantt`. You cannot currently work with page views through the public API.


##### Parent Types
The `parent` object of the view describes what level of hierarchy the view lives on. Since a view can live on the `team` (`Workspace`), `Space`, `Folder`, or `List` level, you must specify this parent type along with its ID. Below are the available types:

- Team: `7`
- List: `6`
- Folder: `5`,
- Space: `4`

Below is an example of the parent object, on a list with the ID `234`.


```
const parent = {
    "type": 6,
    "id": 234
}
```

***Note:** Team level views are the views that live on the `Everything` level in the ClickUp UI.*


#### Grouping
The grouping is basically the first sort field that you want to organize your tasks by. In the ClickUp UI it determines the display that the tasks should be shown in. For example, if you group by `priority`, all tasks in urgent priority will be grouped together and displayed under the red urgent priority flag. You should manipulate this field for views only if those views are intended to be viewed and manipulated through the UI. If you are using views purely for filtering and sorting through the public API, it is recommended that you set your grouping to `none`.

__*Field:*__
To set the group type, you can set `grouping.field` to any of the following values:

- `none` (recommended)
- `status`
- `priority`
- `assignee`
- `tag`
- `dueDate`

__*Dir:*__ Set the group dir to `1` or `-1` to change the direction of the group sort.


#### Filters
Filters are what make views powerful. It gives you the ability to form a complex combination of queries to find exactly the task that you are looking for.

##### Filter Operator
The `op` property of the filters object stands for operator and determines in what way you want multiple filters to behave together. The available values for this property are `AND` and `OR`.

##### Filter Search
The `search` property of the filters object is a filter for task name (it does not search the task description or any other property of the task object). Unlike all of the filters in `filters.fields`, this specific filter does not respect the value of `filters.op` and will always use `AND` in conjunction with other filters.

##### Filter Show Closed
The `show_closed` property is a shorthand filter to toggle the behavior of closed tasks. By default, this property is `false`. You can use the `status` filter (explained below) to achieve a similar outcome, however the main difference with this filter is it does not respect the value of `filters.op` and will always use `AND` in conjunction with other filters (similar to `search`).

##### Filter Fields
The `filters.fields` array is where you will place a majority of your filters. Each object in this array will always follow this format:

```
{
    "field": "field name",
    "op": "op name",
    "values": [] // array of values
}
```

###### Archived
To filter for archived tasks, use the `archived` field.

*Operators:*
- `EQ`
- `NOT`

*Values* - The values array is ignored for this filter

```
{
    "field": "archived",
    "op": "EQ",
    "values": []
}
```

*Values* - An array of `userid`'s
###### Assignee
To filter by assignees, use the `assignee` field.

*Operators:*
- `ANY`
- `ALL`
- `NOT ANY`
- `NOT ALL`

*Values* - An array of `userid`'s

*Example:*

```
{
    "field": "assignee",
    "op": "ANY",
    "values": [182, 183]
}
```

###### Priority
To filter by priority, use the `priority` field.

*Operators:*
- `EQ`
- `NOT`

*Values* - An array of priority values

*Example:*

```
{
    "field": "priority",
    "op": "EQ",
    "values": ["4", "-1"]
}
```

***Note:** `-1` is no priority*

###### Date Filters
To filter by due date, use the `dueDate` field. You can also use the same operators and values for the following date fields, `startDate`, `dateClosed`, `dateCreated`, and `dateUpdated`. To use a Date Custom Field, use the Custom Field name which uses the format `cf_{{field_id}}`. For example, if the id of your Date Custom Field is `ec49d70b-72e1-40c2-b04c-b0f728499f28`, then the field name would be `cf_ec49d70b-72e1-40c2-b04c-b0f728499f28`.

_Operators:_
- `EQ`
- `NOT`

*Values:*
Due date values are dynamic values, which allow you to specify values such as `today` or `overdue` and query due dates without actually setting a specific timestamp. Each value is an object with a descriptive `op` property and sometimes one or more reference values.
- `{ "op": "today" }`
- `{ "op": "yesterday" }`
- `{ "op": "tomorrow" }`
- `{ "op": "next7" }` (next seven days)
- `{ "op": "last7" }` (last seven days)
- `{ "op": "overdue" }`
- `{ "op": "earlier" }` (today and earlier)
- `{ "op": "thisweek" }`
- `{ "op": "thismonth" }`
- `{ "op": "lastmonth" }`
- `{ "op": "eq", "dueDate": 1579240800000 }` (exact date)
- `{ "op": "ls", "dueDate": 1579240800000 }` (before date)
- `{ "op": "gt", "dueDate": 1579240800000 }` (after date)
- `{ "op": "ra", "dueDate": 1579240800000, "startDate": 1579068000000 }` (date range)
- `{ "op": "notNull" }` (any date)
- `{ "op": "null" }` (no date)

*Example:*

```
{
    "field": "dueDate",
    "op": "EQ",
    "values": [{ "op": "notNull" }]
}
```

###### Status
To filter by Statuses, use the `status` field.

_Operators:_
- `EQ`
- `NOT`

*Values:*
Use the `{ "type": "x" }` format to target status types, such as `active`, `done`, or `closed`. Otherwise, pass an array of status names as strings.
- `{ "type": "active" }`
- `{ "type": "done" }`
- `{ "type": "closed" }`
- `"in progress"`

*Example:*

```
{
    "field": "status",
    "op": "EQ",
    "values": ["in progress", { "type": "done" }]
}
```

###### Tag
To filter by tags, use the `tag` field.

*Operators:*
- `ANY`
- `ALL`
- `NOT ANY`
- `NOT ALL`

*Values* - An array of tags names

*Example:*

```
{
    "field": "tag",
    "op": "ANY",
    "values": ["tag 1", "tag 2"]
}
```

###### Recurring
To filter by whether or not tasks are recurring, use the `recurring` field. `EQ` will only include tasks that are recurring, `NOT` only includes tasks that are not recurring.

*Operators:*
- `EQ`
- `NOT`

*Values* - The values array is ignored for this filter but must be included

```
{
    "field": "recurring",
    "op": "EQ",
    "values": []
}
```

###### Custom Fields
To filter by a Custom Field, you must create the field name using the format `cf_{{field_id}}`. For example, if the id of your Custom Field is `ec49d70b-72e1-40c2-b04c-b0f728499f28`, then the field name would be `cf_ec49d70b-72e1-40c2-b04c-b0f728499f28`. You can find the id of the Custom Fields that are available for a given List using the `GET Accessible Custom Fields` call, or for tasks throughout your Workspace using the `Get Filtered team tasks` call.

**Operators:** All Custom Field types can use the filter operators `EQ` and `NOT`. Additionally, you can use the operators `GT`, `GTE`, `LT`, and `LTE` for `number` and `currency` fields. For Date Custom Fields, you can use the Date operators as specified above.

**Values:** The type of values you can add to the `values` array depend on the type of Custom Field that you are filtering by. For instance, for a number field you would pass `[12]`, but to indicate a drop down option, you would pass the ID, like `["435562d0-0b35-4cfe-9726-1c4baf8d1c44"]`. For any Custom Field, you can filter by `is set` and `not set` by passing `{ "op": "NOT", "values": [null] }` (does not equal null) and `{ "op": "NOT", "values": [null] }` (equals null) respectively.

```
{
    "field": "cf_ec49d70b-72e1-40c2-b04c-b0f728499f28",
    "op": "EQ",
    "values": [null]
}
```

#### Sorting
Add sorting options by passing sort objects to the `view.sorting.fields` array. You can include a `dir` value of `1` or `-1` to specify a sort direction. You can use any `field` value that you can use in filters, as specified above.

#### Columns
Specify the columns that are visible to you in the UI by adding column objects to the `view.columns.fields` array. You can use any `field` value that you can use in filters, as specified above.

#### Get View Tasks
Finally, you can use the `GET /api/v2/view/{{view_id}}/tasks` route to get the resulting tasks from your view query. You must create a view first with the view CRUD operations to get the `view_id`.

## Webhooks [/webhook]

The ClickUp API 2.0 now supports webhooks to notify you when changes are made to your resources. If you have not used webhooks before, our friends from Zapier have put together a great [post](https://zapier.com/blog/what-are-webhooks/) that describes them in detail.

### Events
Below are a list of events that you can subscribe to in order to listen to specific changes to your resources. You can also pass the wildcard `*` to listen to all events that are available.

- taskCreated
- taskUpdated
- taskDeleted
- taskPriorityUpdated
- taskStatusUpdated
- taskAssigneeUpdated
- taskDueDateUpdated
- taskTagUpdated
- taskMoved
- taskCommentPosted
- taskCommentUpdated
- taskTimeEstimateUpdated
- taskTimeTrackedUpdated
- listCreated
- listUpdated
- listDeleted
- folderCreated
- folderUpdated
- folderDeleted
- spaceCreated
- spaceUpdated
- spaceDeleted
- goalCreated
- goalUpdated
- goalDeleted
- keyResultCreated
- keyResultUpdated
- keyResultDeleted

### Endpoint
When an event occurs that your webhoook is subscribed to, we will send details about that change to the endpoint that you provided when you create the webhook. If no protocol is provided on the endpoint, the default will be https. In the future, non-ssl may not be supported so it is highly recommended to use the secure protocol when possible.

Requests to your endpoints will always adhere to the following criteria:
- Always sent with the method `POST`
- The `Content-Type` will always be `application/json`
- The `webhook_id`, `event`, and resource ID will be passed in the body.
- If a history item exists describing the event, it will be passed in a `history_items` array.

An example request:
```
POST https://yourdomain.com/webhook
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "webhook_id": "7689a169-a000-4985-8676-6902b96d6627",
    "event": "taskUpdated",
    "task_id":"c0j",
    "history_items": [
        {
            "id":"33169",
            "type":1,
            "date":"1575650190085",
            "field":"status",
            "parent_id":"1753",
            "data":{
                "status_type":"closed"
            },
            "source":null,
            "user":{
                "id":183,
                "username":"John Doe",
                "email":"example@email.com",
                "color":"#827718",
                "initials":"JK",
                "profilePicture":"https://dev-attachments-public.clickup.com/profilePictures/183_nx1.jpg"
            },
            "before":{
                "status":"open",
                "color":"#d3d3d3",
                "orderindex":0,
                "type":"open"
            },
            "after":{
                "status":"complete",
                "color":"#6bc950",
                "orderindex":1,
                "type":"closed"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Webhook Health Status
To ensure the efficient use of our resources here at ClickUp, the health of the webhooks that you create will be monitored. As long as the endpoints that you provide us send a successful HTTP status code in a timely manner, your webhook will stay active and healthy. If an endpoint becomes degraded, we will set your webhook to the appropriate health status described below.

#### `active`
If your webhook is sending us healthy http status codes, we will keep sending your subscribed changes to the endpoint.

#### `failing`
If an unsuccessful http status code is received or if a request takes longer that 15 seconds to complete, we will consider the webhook as failing. We understand though that flukes can happen, so we will retry your webhook five times for each event. If on the fifth retry the endpoint is still failing, we will increment a `fail_count` which you can see in the webhook `health` object. This count will be incremented for each event that we fail to send you.

If at any time while your webhook is marked as `failing` the issues with your endpoint are resolved and success status codes are received, we will automatically mark your webhook back to the `active` status and clear the `fail_count`.

#### `suspended`
If your webhook is set as `failing` and the fail count reaches 100, we will mark the webhook as suspended. We will no longer attempt to send events to this webhook. The only way reactivate this webhook is to fix the endpoint and set the status back to `active` using the `PUT /api/v2/webhook/{webhook_id}` request.

### `401 Gone`
Sometimes the webhooks that you create are no longer necessary to keep active. As a convenience to you, we will immediately mark webhooks as suspended if a `401` http status code is received.

### Signature
All requests sent to your webhook endpoints will be signed so that you can verify that traffic coming to your servers is coming from ClickUp. To sign our requests, we use a hash-based message authentication code, or [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

Each webhook that is created will be provided with a `secret` which can be found on any of the CRUD webhook endpoints. When a request is sent to your webhook endpoint a signature will be created by hashing the body of the request that is being sent with the shared secret. This signature is sent in the `X-Signature` http header so that the client can verify it was made with the same secret that it has access to.

An example event request sent to a webhook endpoint:
```
POST https://yourdomain.com/webhook
Content-Type: application/json
X-Signature: f7bc83f430538424b13298e6aa6

{
    "webhook_id": "7689a169-a000-4985-8676-6902b96d6627",
    "event": "taskCreated",
    "task_id":"c0j"
}
```

The `X-Signature` value for this request was created by creating a `SHA-256` hash of the above request body using the provided `secret` as a key. In order for the client to verify the signature, it can create a hash signature using the same algorithm and see if the value matches. Below is an example using Node.js. You can find examples using other languages [here](https://github.com/danharper/hmac-examples).

```
const crypto = require('crypto');

const key = 'secret'; // from the webhook object
const body = '{"webhook_id":"7689a169-a000-4985-8676-6902b96d6627","event":"taskCreated","task_id":"c0j"}';

const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', key).update(body);

const signature = hash.digest('hex');
```

***Note:** The body in this example already exists as a string. If you are using an http client that automatically parses request bodies, you must stringify the object with no white spaces inserted*

***Note:** Signatures will always be digested using hexadecimal*

***Note:** Only webhooks that were created by the authenticated user will be returned on the fetch webhook endpoints.*

### Create Webhook [POST /team/{team_id}/webhook]

+ Parameters
    + team_id: 123 (number) - Team ID (Workspace)

+ Request
You may filter the location of resources that get sent to a webhook by passing an optional `space_id`, `folder_id`, `list_id`, or `task_id` in the body of the request.
Without specifying any events, all event types will be sent to the webhook. However, you can filter for specific actions by sending an `events` array.
To subscribe to specific events, pass an array of `events` that you want to subscribe to, otherwise pass `"*"` to subscribe to everything.
